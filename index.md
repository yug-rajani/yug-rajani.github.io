# About

I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences in Boston. As a passionate Computer Science graduate student, I'm always exploring novel applications of my technical skills.

With a background in software development and robust problem-solving abilities, I swiftly adapt to new technologies. I'm skilled in Java and Python, well-versed in Object-Oriented concepts, Data Structures, and Algorithms. My dedication to best programming practices ensures clean and efficient code.

Beyond studies, I have contributed as a Research Assistant at the NU WiNS Lab, analyzing 5G mm wave data in Boston, and engaged as a Teaching Assistant for CS 3200 and CS 5200, helping students comprehend Database Design concepts.

Before enrolling in the MS CS program, I gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer at Crest Data Systems Pvt. Ltd. There, I successfully delivered software solutions meeting clients' needs, honing my collaborative and independent problem-solving skills. I also mentored interns in Elasticsearch, guiding their professional growth.

Driven by a passion for growth, I am excited to expand my skill set and build upon my experiences. I am currently seeking Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship/co-op opportunities for Spring/Summer 2024. If you know of suitable roles or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out.
