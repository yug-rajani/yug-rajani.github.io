# About

I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](http://northeastern.edu)'s [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu) in Boston. As a passionate Computer Science graduate student, I'm always exploring novel applications of my technical skills.

With a background in software development and robust problem-solving abilities, I swiftly adapt to new technologies. I'm skilled in Java and Python, well-versed in Object-Oriented concepts, Data Structures, and Algorithms. My dedication to best programming practices ensures clean and efficient code.

Beyond studies, I have contributed as a Research Assistant at the NU WiNS Lab, analyzing 5G mm wave data in Boston, and engaged as a Teaching Assistant for CS 3200 and CS 5200, helping students comprehend Database Design concepts.

Before enrolling in the MS CS program, I gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer at Crest Data Systems Pvt. Ltd. There, I successfully delivered software solutions meeting clients' needs, honing my collaborative and independent problem-solving skills. I also mentored interns in Elasticsearch, guiding their professional growth.

Motivated by my passion for growth, I'm eager to broaden my skills and capitalize on my experiences. Currently seeking SDE internship/co-op positions for Spring/Summer 2024, If you know of suitable roles or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out.
