# About

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences in Boston, MA. As a dedicated Computer Science graduate student, I am constantly exploring new and innovative applications of my technical skills.

My experience in software development, combined with strong problem-solving abilities, enables me to quickly adapt to emerging technologies. Proficient in Java and Python, I possess a solid understanding of Object-Oriented concepts, Data Structures, and Algorithms. My commitment to best programming practices ensures clean and efficient code.

Outside of academics, I contribute as a Research Assistant at the NU WiNS Lab, actively involved in collecting and analyzing 5G mm wave data. I also engage as a Teaching Assistant, helping students grasp Database Design concepts.

Before enrolling in the MS CS program, I gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer at Crest Data Systems Pvt. Ltd. There, I successfully delivered software solutions meeting clients' needs, honing my collaborative and independent problem-solving skills. I also mentored interns in Elasticsearch, guiding their professional growth.

Driven by a passion for growth, I am excited to expand my skill set and build upon my experiences. I am currently seeking Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship/co-op opportunities for Spring/Summer 2024. If you know of suitable roles or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out.
