# About

I'm currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University. As a CS grad student, I'm always exploring new applications for my technical skills. With a background in software development, strong problem-solving abilities, and adaptability to new tech, I'm skilled in Java, Python, and fundamental concepts like OOP, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

I'm a Research Assistant at NU WiNS Lab, working on 5G mm wave data analysis, and also a Teaching Assistant, guiding students in Database Design. My prior role as a Software Engineer at Crest Data Systems honed my collaboration and problem-solving skills.

Eager to expand my skills, I'm excited about new opportunities and learning from industry pros. Seeking SDE internships/co-ops for Spring/Summer 2024. Feel free to [check my resume](/cv.pdf).

<!-- The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](/posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](/404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).

Below is a list of blog posts included for illustrative purposes. Make sure to delete or modify them before deploying your website.
