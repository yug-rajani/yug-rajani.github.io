# About

Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](http://northeastern.edu)'s [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu) in Boston, I'm a dedicated CS graduate student driven by continuous skill exploration.

Experienced in software development and problem-solving, I quickly adapt to new tech. Proficient in Java, Python, OOP, Data Structures, and Algorithms, I emphasize clean code through best practices.

Beyond studies, I have contributed as a Research Assistant at the [NU WiNS Lab](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/dkoutsonikolas/nuwins/), analyzing 5G mm wave data in Boston, and engaged as a Teaching Assistant, helping students comprehend Database Design concepts.

As a former Software Engineer at [Crest Data Systems Pvt. Ltd.](http://crestdatasys.com), I successfully delivered software solutions meeting clients' needs, honing my collaborative and independent problem-solving skills. I also mentored interns in Elasticsearch, guiding their professional development.

Eager for growth, I'm actively seeking Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship/co-op roles for Spring/Summer 2024. If you know any relevant positions or wish to connect, please [reach out](mailto:rajani.y@northeastern.edu).

Feel free to browse my resume [here](/cv) or download the PDF [here](http://yug-rajani.github.io/resume/){:target="_blank"}. And hey, if you're up for it, let's catch up over coffee â€“ my treat!
